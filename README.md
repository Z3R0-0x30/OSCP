Hey there! I’m **Z3R0x30**, a passionate **pentester**, **red teamer**, and **offensive hacker** with a deep interest in pushing the boundaries of security. Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of working on various types of challenges, and one of the things I enjoy most is solving complex problems in creative ways.

On this page, I’ll be sharing my **HTB writeups** — a series of detailed walkthroughs on different Hack The Box (HTB) machines. Whether you're preparing for your **OSCP** certification, diving into penetration testing, or just enjoying the journey of hacking, I hope these writeups can help you level up your skills and knowledge.

My Passion Areas:

This series is intended to help both beginners and advanced learners alike. Whether you're new to the scene or looking for more in-depth technical content, there will be something here for everyone. Stay tuned for regular updates as I continue exploring new HTB boxes and sharing my approach to solving them.
