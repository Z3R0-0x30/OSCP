# Hello fellow hackers, this is Prince 👾

Welcome to my journey towards conquering the **OSCP**! As a passionate cybersecurity enthusiast, I know firsthand how challenging it is to find a clear path to the OSCP certification. While I haven’t earned the cert yet, I’ll be documenting my progress live—sharing my thoughts, writeups, and experiences as I work through **Hack The Box** machines and sharpen my offensive security skills.

> ⚠️ I don’t claim to have the perfect roadmap—no one truly does. But I _can_ offer you my personal journey as a guide, and maybe that can light the path for others walking the same road.

## 💡 Why Hack The Box?

A few years back, I asked myself: _“Where do I even begin my OSCP journey?”_ I was overwhelmed by the lack of structured advice. That was until I stumbled across a brilliant resource by one of my mentors—[Rana Khalil’s GitBook](https://rana-khalil.gitbook.io/hack-the-box-oscp-preparation). It opened my eyes.

From there, I discovered [TJ Null’s list of Hack The Box OSCP-like VMs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1dwSMIAPIam0PuRBkCiDI88pU3yzrqqHkDtBngUHNCw8/htmlview#), and I decided to compile my own curated list. I merged boxes from **PWK v1**, **v2**, and **v3**, ending up with nearly **200 machines**.

Now, I’m fully committed to solving them—not just for OSCP prep, but to feed my curiosity and passion for hacking. As a red teamer, **Hack The Box** has become my playground, and I’m loving every bit of it.

If you’re just starting out, here are some resources I recommend:

- [rana-khalil-gitbook](https://rana-khalil.gitbook.io/hack-the-box-oscp-preparation)
- [TJ Null's HTB OSCP List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1dwSMIAPIam0PuRBkCiDI88pU3yzrqqHkDtBngUHNCw8/htmlview#)
- [IppSec on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@ippsec) — a goldmine of walkthroughs and techniques

I’ll be sharing writeups and insights regularly. My aim? To help as many people as possible gain something valuable from my journey.

## 🚀 Before Hack The Box

If you’re _completely new_ to offensive security, I wouldn’t recommend jumping straight into **Hack The Box** or the **OSCP**.

Start with something that builds foundational knowledge—like the [TryHackMe Offensive Pentesting Path](https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/pentesting). It’s beginner-friendly and structured with everything you need to know before diving into the deeper waters.

Also, spend some time with great content creators like:

- [HackerSploit](https://www.youtube.com/@HackerSploit)
- [John Hammond](https://www.youtube.com/@_JohnHammond)

HTB can be overwhelming if you aren’t prepared—but with the right foundation, it becomes an incredible learning platform. For me, with 8 years of offensive security experience (as of 2025), HTB feels like fun and games.

## 🧠 Final Words

Back when I started, we didn’t have access to amazing YouTube educators or comprehensive guides. But today, _you_ do.

There’s now a full, structured syllabus from beginner to pro—so **use it**. Take advantage of it. Learn, grow, and don’t stop hacking.

I don’t consider myself a professional—and maybe I never will. There’s always someone better, faster, smarter. But what I _do_ want is to build a powerful, supportive community where we all rise together.
